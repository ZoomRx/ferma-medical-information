Overview

Kisqali® (ribociclib), a kinase inhibitor, is indicated in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib in combination with everolimus and exemestane is investigational.  Efficacy and safety have not been established.  There is no guarantee that this combination will become commercially available for uses under investigation.

A triplet combination therapy study was conducted with ribociclib plus everolimus (EVE) plus exemestane (EXE) to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy results of from the ongoing Phase Ib (CLEE011X2106, NCT01857193) study in postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2– advanced breast cancer (aBC) refractory to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (letrozole or anastrozole).  Results from the study are summarized below.  Potential predictive biomarkers of response were also explored.
