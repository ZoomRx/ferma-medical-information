Read the entire content provided as the input query thoroughly.

1)category:
Identify and answer the question "Is this session about a clinical trial/preclinical/general?"
- you can understand this if the session is about clinical trial in human or discussing clinical trial data (in human) - categorise as "Clinical". Even if there is no trial_identifier or trial_acronym, but is a clinical trial data in human, categorise as "Clinical"
- Preclinical study in animal model, cell lines or in silico, etc - classify as "Preclinical".
- If it is a general discussion about targeting a disease, mechanism of action of a known drug without any mentions of a trial or a preclinical inference, it will be "General"
- All retrospective study, post-hoc analysis, meta-analysis, systemic reviews that are not having any clinical trial identifiers are to be categorised as "General".
- Answer only with the term "Clinical" or "Preclinical" or "General".
Example format of output "Category: Clinical".

2)trial_identifier
- This should only include specific identifiers mentioned in the input query that are clearly labeled and directly related to clinical trials.
Example Format 1: "Trial Identifier: NCT03682536", if no value return "-".

3)trial_acronym
- This should be a specific Trial Acronym (such as Checkmate-008, SUNRISE-002) mentioned in the input query mentioned in the input query directly related to clinical trials.
- Read the entire context before returning data. DO NOT include anything that you are doubtful that it may not refer to a trial.
-DO NOT INTENTIONALLY MISS OUT ON ACRONYM if it is present in the input
Example format: "trial_acronym: KEYNOTE-522"
- If no trial acronym found, return "-".

4)primary_drug, secondary_drug and comparator_drug:
-Read through entire context and return ONLY INTERVENTIONAL DRUG, Active ingredient, drug class like Inhibitors, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc.
-DO NOT return terms like Placebo, Buffer, Saline, New entity, Novel, First-in-class, Observation, behavioral, procedure, concentration or dosage under drugs.
- MUST Review the entire input query thoroughly to capture appropriate drugs
- DO NOT return drug name if it is non-interventional like "Tamoxifen resistant", "Cisplatin pretreated", "<Drug> intolerant", etc.
Example: Palbociclib resistant Lung Cancer, here Palbociclib is NOT a DRUG as it is non-interventional.
- Follow each instruction detailed below to enable classification.

INSTRUCTIONS:
a. primary_drug-
-It can be either a single drug or multiple drugs or a sequence of drugs.
-If it is multiple drugs, Primary drug can be identified with patterns that signify the equal importance of the drug combination tested for the session.
- MUST classify drugs with the following PATTERNS as Primary Drug:
"in combination", "together", "and", "with", "+", "plus", "followed by" etc.
-It can be a brand, generic, imaging agent like [18F]-FDG, genetic product like Oncolytic Virus CF33-expressing hNIS/Anti-PD-L1 Antibody, vaccines like Allogeneic Myeloma Vaccine, cell products like CAR-T Cell, Lymphocyte, etc.
-If the drugs are mentioned for chemotherapy or regimen, return them in output. Eg: Input:chemo consisting of paclitaxel; carboplatin, then Output: Paclitaxel; Carboplatin
-If both brand and generic name for the same primary drug is present, Return ONLY the brand name. Example: Olaparib (Lynparza) for NSCLC, return Primary drug: Lynparza.
-DO NOT return synonymous mentions of a drug present within brackets as 2 different terms. Example: Pembrolizumab (mk-3475) for advanced urothelial cancer. Return ONLY Pembrolizumab as primary drug. DO NOT return the alphanumeric synonym: mk-3475 as a primary drug as it is a synonym to Pembrolizumab.
- The examples below have some patterns that has been highlighted within quotes for you to understand drug classification patterns:
Eg 1: Input- Olaparib "+" alpelisib "followed by" chemoradiotherapy for CRC; Output- Primary drug: Olaparib; Alpelisib; Chemoradiotherapy
Eg 2: Input- Pembrolizumab "in combination with" chemotherapy; Output- Primary drug: Pembrolizumab; Chemotherapy

b. secondary_drug
-Secondary drug is a drug that may or may not be given with the primary drug, but is NEVER the comparator.
- MUST classify drugs with the following PATTERNS as Secondary drug:
"with or without", "with/without", "and/or", "monotherapy and in combination with", "+/-", etc.
- The examples below have some patterns that has been highlighted within quotes for you to understand drug classification patterns:
Eg 1: Input - Myeloma Vaccine "with" FOLFIRINOX "+/-" Pembrolizumab
Output: Primary Drug: Myeloma Vaccine; FOLFIRINOX
Secondary Drug: Pembrolizumab
Eg 2: Input: Enzalutamide "in combination with" Olaparib (Lynparza) "with/without" Dacarbazine, Output: Primary Drug: Enzalutamide; Lynparza
Secondary Drug: Dacarbazine

c. comparator_drug
- This is the drug against which the primary/secondary drug is compared in the input context. It can be single or multiple drugs.
- MUST classify drugs with the following PATTERNS as Comparator drug:
"versus", "vs", "compared with", "compared to", etc.
- If the same drug is present as both primary and comparator, return the drug under both. Refer to the example below,
Example 1: Input - Olaparib (OLA) "vs" OLA "plus" Durvalumab
Output: Primary Drug: Olaparib
Secondary Drug:-
Comparator Drug: Olaparib; Durvalumab
Example 2: Input - Alpelisib "in monotherapy or with" cisplatin "compared to" SOC (carboplatin/cisplatin)
Output: Primary Drug: Alpelisib
Secondary Drug: Cisplatin
Comparator Drug: Carboplatin; Cisplatin

Example 3: Input- Updated results from an ongoing phase 1/2a study of T3011, an oncolytic HSV expressing IL-12 and PD-1 antibody, administered via IT injection "as monotherapy or combined with" pembrolizumab "vs" radiation therapy "given along with" olaparib in advanced solid tumors.
Output
Primary drug: T3011
Secondary drug: Pembrolizumab
Comparator drug: Radiation Therapy; Olaparib

**CRITICAL DATA CLASSIFICATION MANDATE: CONSIDER ONLY TITLE and BACKGROUND of the input query ONLY to enable classification of the drug to primary drug/secondary drug/comparator drug by identifying patterns as listed under each category discussed above. Ensure the PATTERN is identified correctly from the title and drug classification is made accordingly, double-check your submission before giving the output. The drugs MUST be picked by analysing and going through the entire input context thoroughly as explained above. DO NOT return drug name if it is mentioned in a non-interventional context like "<Drug> resistant", "<Drug> pretreated", "<Drug> intolerant". This step is non-negotiable and must be adhered to before proceeding to the classification of the drug. Failure to comply with this mandate will result in incomplete and inaccurate data, which is unacceptable.**

Example:
Input:
Title: Outcomes with first-line (1L) Alpelisib + endocrine therapy (ET) vs combination chemotherapy (combo CT) in pre/perimenopausal patients Ovarian Cancer
Background: "...Alpelisib + ET over combo CT..."
Methods:"...systemic therapy Alpelisib with letrozole/anastrozole + goserelin or of combo CT (docetaxel + capecitabine, paclitaxel + gemcitabine, or capecitabine + vinorelbine)..."
Results:"...significant PFS benefit with Alpelisib + ET vs combo CT..."
Conclusions: "... improved secondary outcomes with Alpelisib + ET over combo CT..."
Output:
Primary Drug: Alpelisib; Letrozole; Anastrozole; Goserelin
Secondary Drug:-
Comparator Drug: Docetaxel; Capecitabine; Paclitaxel; Gemcitabine; Vinorelbine

5) indication
-Indication is the disease or condition along with the patient populations considered for that disease in the conference session. The extraction of indication MUST be as specific as possible, including the disease or condition with the relevant patient populations.
-Below are a few categories that MUST be considered for the patient population,
  - Stages of disease: Outline its progression or severity, often represented as stages like I, II, III, IV, etc.
  - Mutation type/Biomarkers: Identify genetic alterations relevant to the disease, such as "EGFR-Positive", "KRAS G12C mutant", "HER2-Overexpressing" etc.
  - Patient subgroup: Pinpoint the specific group being treated or studied, such as "Previously Treated", "Advanced", "Pediatric", "Adult", "Elderly" etc.

  - Do not include exclusion criteria in the indications. Example: For metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer excluding patients with CNS metastases, RETURN indication as Metastatic HER2 Positive Breast Cancer.

*Example Format for indication output: "Advanced Fourth-line Relapsed/Recurrent BRCA-mutant or DDR-mutated EBV-Positive Lynch Syndrome and Lung Cancer previously treated with Aromatase Inhibitors"*

6) disease
-Extract ONLY the disease information (EXCLUDE all patient population info).
