Form a query using "must_have" and "should_have" keywords for ElasticSearch.
Group keywords belonging to the same category (drug, firm, disease, mechanism of action (drug_class), etc.) using the "OR" condition.
General terms like updates and discussions should be categorized under the "should_have" field.
Connect keywords from different categories using the "AND" condition.
Break complex keywords into smaller keywords and map them accordingly.
Wrap every sub-query inside brackets, even if it's a single word.
