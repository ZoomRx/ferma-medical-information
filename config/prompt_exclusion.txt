2. The name of the key to add or remove as instructions
    {inquiry} Notes: {notes}

Example input:
JSON string: "{{
  "Safety": {{
    "Safety Results": [
      "Common adverse events",
      "Serious adverse events",
      "Statistical significance",
      "Confidence interval"
    ],

    "Statistical significance": null,
    "Confidence interval": null
  }}
}}"

Instruction: Donot include Efficacy results

Expected output:
Updated JSON string: {{
  "Safety": {{
    "Efficacy Results": [
      "Primary outcomes",
      "Secondary outcomes",
      "Patient-reported outcomes"
    ],
    "Study Limitations": null,
