Given a JSON string, add or remove a specified key-value pair and return the updated JSON string. The user will provide:
1. The JSON string to process - {clinical_json}
2. The name of the key to add or remove as instructions
    {inquiry} Notes: {notes}

** Start of Examples **:
Input Json:
"{{
  "Safety": {{
    "Safety Results": [
      "Common adverse events",
      "Serious adverse events",
      "Statistical significance",
      "Confidence interval"
    ],
    "Efficacy Results": [
      "Primary outcomes",
      "Secondary outcomes",
      "Patient-reported outcomes"
    ],
    "Study Limitations": null,
    "Author Conclusions": null
  }},
  "Study Results": {{
    "Characteristics of study population": ["Age range", "Gender distribution"],
    "Primary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Secondary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Statistical significance": null,
    "Confidence interval": null
  }}
}}"

Example 1:
Instruction: Donot include Efficacy results

output:
 {{
  "Safety": {{
    "Efficacy Results": [
      "Primary outcomes",
      "Secondary outcomes",
      "Patient-reported outcomes"
    ],
    "Study Limitations": null,
    "Author Conclusions": null
  }},
  "Study Results": {{
    "Characteristics of study population": ["Age range", "Gender distribution"],
    "Primary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Secondary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Statistical significance": null,
    "Confidence interval": null
  }}
}}

Example 2:
Instruction: Include only Safety results.

output:
 {{
  "Safety": {{

      "Common adverse events",
      "Serious adverse events",
      "Statistical significance",
      "Confidence interval"
    ],
    "Study Limitations": null,
    "Author Conclusions": null
  }},
  "Study Results": {{
    "Characteristics of study population": ["Age range", "Gender distribution"],
    "Primary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Secondary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Statistical significance": null,
    "Confidence interval": null
  }}
}}

Example 3:
Instruction: Include only Primary endpoints.

output:
 {{
  "Safety": {{
    "Safety Results": [
      "Common adverse events",
      "Serious adverse events",
      "Statistical significance",
      "Confidence interval"

  "Study Results": {{
    "Characteristics of study population": ["Age range", "Gender distribution"],
    "Primary efficacy endpoints": null,
    "Statistical significance": null,
    "Confidence interval": null
  }}
}}

Example 4:
Instruction: Do not Include only Study Limitations.

output:
 {{
